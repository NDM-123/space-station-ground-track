# space-station-ground-track

Our  research  to  track  the  space  station  used  a  number  of  elements.	Image processing  is  done  using  opencv.  OpenCV  is  the  huge  open-source  library  for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By  using  it,  one  can  process  images  and  videos  to  identify  objects,  faces,  or even handwriting  of a human.  When it integrated  with various libraries,  such as  Numpuy,  python  is  capable  of  processing  the  OpenCV  array  structure  for analysis.  To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.  Telescope- NEXSTAR
8SE COMPUTERIZED TELESCOPE Connection to the telescope was through a  library  in  Python  created  by  a  company  of  the  telescope.  Camera-  Use  the levenhuk t 80As an optical camera Preliminary experiment - the first experiment we performed we performed using a balloon inflator.  We took a video of a simple balloon in the air which makes a continuous movement.  The algorithm detected the balloon and continued to track.  The challenge we faced at the space station is more complex as we need to connect more elements of telescope, camera and live broadcast.  The first challenge is to aim the camera at the iss.
